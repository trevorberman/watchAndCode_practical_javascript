This repo contains coursework and the finished project files for all the learning goals contained in the curriculum.

## Bonus: Progressive Enhancement

Applying the following practices to increase my modern web development knowledge and skills.

- Track all progress using git
  - Branching and merging
  - Semantic versioning
    - Start at 0.1.0 since there's no no public API and the entire project/coursework is in an initial development phase.
    - ~~?? Denote the version in 'git tag' or 'git commit' and on 'master' or branches or both?~~
    - **While branching and merging V1 of this project into remote repo, document process in a blog post following the digram and instructions in https://github.com/trevorberman/watchAndCode_practical_javascript/issues/1 == how to for self and tut for others!**
- Lint all code in the editor
- Enforce formatting standards
- Conduct functional tests through Dev Tools linked to local source files
